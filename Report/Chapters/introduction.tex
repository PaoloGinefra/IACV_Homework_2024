\section{Problem definition}
In this section, the problem at hand will be described in detail referencing the "Homework Assignment 2024-25" document.
\subsection{Scene description}
 A piece of furniture is a rectangular parallelepiped, whose width (along the X-axis) is $l = 1$. 
The other dimensions, namely the depth $m$ along the $Y$ axis and the height $h$ along the $Z$-axis are 
unknown. In addition, a horizontal circumference (i.e., parallel to the X-Y plane) is visible. 
Furthermore, an unknown horizontal planar curve is also visible, placed at midheight $h$/2.
