\section{Question 1 - the vanishing line of the horizontal plane}
\label{th_1}

For this section, the images $l_i \: \forall i \in \{1, ...,  3\}$ and $m_j \: \forall j \in \{1, ...,  5\}$ of the horizontal and vertical lines visible in the picture are assumed to be expressed in homogeneous coordinates.

A point $p = \colvec{a \\ b}$ 

$\matrixdim{2}{3}{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}$
$\matrixdim{1}{3}{1, 1, 1}$
$\matrixdim{2}{4}{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}$
$\matrixdim{1}{4}{1, 1, 1, \frac{2}{3}}$

The goal of this task is to compute the image $l'_\infty$ of the vanishing line of the horizontal plane. Luckily, all the lines corresponding to one of the $l_i$ are parallel to each other and they will thus all meet at a single point at infinity
