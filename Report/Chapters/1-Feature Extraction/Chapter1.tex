\section{Conic Extraction}
In order to extract the conic $C$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cropping the image to the desired portion

    \caption{\label{fig:Vanishing Line}The Extracted image of the vanishing line}
    \end{figure}

    \item Convert to grayscale

    \item Canny edge detection ($\sigma = 2$, threshold = $[0, 0.15]$)

    \item Remove edges that are too crowded, like the holes of the colander. To do that, first heavily blur the image ($\sigma = 10$) then threshold the image to select the sparser areas ($\leq 0.1$). Use this to mask the edges

    \item Extract the remaining points $\neq 0$ and use a slightly modified RANSAC to extract the Conic with the most inliers 
\end{enumerate}
